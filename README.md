Techdegree Project 2

- Create and append the pagination links
- Break stundentlist down into pages 
- Hide all but the first 10 students when the page loads
- When a user clicks on “2” in the pagination, students 11 through 20 are shown. When a user clicks “3”, students 21 through 30 are shown. And so on.

Extra Credit:
- Add search component
- When the "Search" button is clicked, the list of students is filtered to match the search value.
- Display pagination links based on how many search results are returned. For example: if 10
or fewer results are returned, 0 or 1 pagination links are displayed.
- If no matches are found by the search, include a message in the HTML to tell the user there
are no matches.
